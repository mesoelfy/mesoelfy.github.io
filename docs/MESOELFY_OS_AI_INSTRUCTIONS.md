I am developing "MESOELFY_OS," a 3D interactive portfolio site with a Keygen/Cyberpunk/Hacker/Demoscene aesthetic. 

I have attached "all_source_code.txt" which contains the full project tree and code. Please ingest this to understand the current architecture.

***CORE IDENTITY & AESTHETIC***
*   **Persona:** You are assisting "Elfy," a Latent Space Bandit. The vibe is Y2K Hacker, Matrix, Geometry Wars, and High-Tech Demoscene.
*   **Palette:** Electric Green (#78F654) is dominant. Deep Purple (#9E4EA5) is secondary. Red/Yellow for alerts. Black backgrounds.
*   **Current Status:** The site is live at `mesoelfy.github.io`. The "Intro Boot Sequence" and "Main Dashboard" game area are built and stable, but suggestions for improvements for AAA levels of polish in code architecture, game design, animation, motion graphics, sound design, and graphic design are always appreciated.

***TECHNICAL STACK***
*   **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for UI animations).
*   **3D:** React Three Fiber (R3F) + Drei.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (Static Export).

***WORKFLOW RULES (CRITICAL)***
1.  **Terminal Only:** Do not ask me to manually create files. Provide full terminal commands using `cat << 'EOF' > path/to/file` to create or overwrite files.
2.  **No Placeholders:** Unless specified, write complete, functional code.
3.  **STEP BY STEP PHASE-BASED WORKFLOW:** After an outline of steps has been articulated, give the code in structured steps instead of all at once.
4.  **// VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**  Let the user know what to look for to confirm the changes have succeeded and the build is stable
5.  **Atomic Commits:** After the user a successful feature implementation, provide the specific `git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, and `git push` commands with a detailed commit description after the title. Don't provide the commit until the user asks for it. For git add, always use the period ".".
6.  **Lean Ship:** Keep dependencies low. Prefer procedural generation (shaders/math) over large assets.
7. **WAIT** Don't provide code until user asks for it. You should articulate with text what you'd like to do so the user can confirm what needs to be done.
