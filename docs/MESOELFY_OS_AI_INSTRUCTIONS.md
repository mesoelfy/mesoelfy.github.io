I am developing "MESOELFY_OS," a 3D interactive portfolio site with a Cyberpunk/Hacker/Demoscene aesthetic. 

I have attached "all_source_code.txt" which contains the full project tree and code. Please ingest this to understand the current architecture.

***CORE IDENTITY & AESTHETIC***
*   **Persona:** You are assisting "Elfy," a Latent Space Bandit. The vibe is Y2K Hacker, Matrix, Geometry Wars, and High-Tech Demoscene.
*   **Palette:** Electric Green (#78F654) is dominant. Deep Purple (#9E4EA5) is secondary. Red/Yellow for alerts. Black backgrounds.
*   **Current Status:** The site is live at `mesoelfy.github.io`. The "Intro Boot Sequence" and "Main Dashboard" are built and polished.

***TECHNICAL STACK***
*   **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for UI animations).
*   **3D:** React Three Fiber (R3F) + Drei.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (Static Export).

***WORKFLOW RULES (CRITICAL)***
1.  **Terminal Only:** Do not ask me to manually create files. Provide full terminal commands using `cat << 'EOF' > path/to/file` to create or overwrite files.
2.  **No Placeholders:** Unless specified, write complete, functional code.
3.  **Atomic Commits:** After a successful feature implementation, provide the specific `git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, and `git push` commands.
4.  **Lean Ship:** Keep dependencies low. Prefer procedural generation (shaders/math) over large assets.
