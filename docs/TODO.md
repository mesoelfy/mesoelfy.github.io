# MESOELFY_OS // DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP


## LATER
- [ ] **Save State:** Track how many times the player has died even if they refresh or come back at a later date.
- [ ] **Content Injection:** Fill JSON files with final text/links/images.

## KNOWN BUGS
- [ ] **White Flash on Refresh (FOUC):** The 3D Canvas areas flash white briefly on page reload.


## THOUGHTS

- should enemies come in waves indicated in MESOELFY_OS Header?
- instead of just panel munchers (rename from seeker), what if there is also a muncher enemy that targets the elements within a panel such as each of the three video slots or each social media button, or the CONTACT and ABOUT ME buttons? What about an enemy type that enters a modal and does damage inside? Can that be coded for them to be moving around doing stuff even though we haven't instantiated the modal yet? How do we deal with the enemies on the MESOELFY_OS screen if we are inside a modal fighting some enemies? Wouldn't that have weird game logic? I need to brainstorm this with AI.
- need health for player and lives and powerups. (increase bullet size / rate of fire)
- need help seeing not obvious stuff that is missing.
- hunter enemy needs to shoot projectiles.
- Kamekazi should be bigger and slow. If it blows up on player and is inside a panel, it does damage to that panel.
